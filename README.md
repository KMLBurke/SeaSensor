# SeaSensor
Monitoring TBay

Design and build an ocean proof enclosure housing a microcontroller connected to sensors (temp, accelerometer, Gyro) . Enclosure to be attached to marine buoy.

Requirements

LPWAN enabled micrrocontrolled (Pycom SiPy/LoPy)
LiPo battery (high capacity)
Waterproof temperature Sensor (DS18B20)
Waterproof Accelerometer
Waterproof Gyro
Ocean proof housing allowing for exposure of antenna and temperature sensor. (3d printed).

Additional: Possible way to measure current direction and force.
3x flow meters or pressure sensors
